# ğŸ¤– MCP Client as a durable object

This example shows a working pattern using durable objects as an MCP client.

To start, install depdencies in `/` and `/server`

```
npm i
```
To start the server, run `npm run start` in `server/`

To start the client, run `npm run start` in `/`


Ask `Can you add 5 and 6`?

The client will make a call to the server, get the response and show it to the client.
